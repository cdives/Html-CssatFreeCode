Alexander Grothedieck was born on 28 March 1928 in Berlin, Germany  His father, Alexander "Sascha" Schapiro had Hassidic roots and had been imprisoned in Russia before moving to Germany in 1922, while his mother, Johanna "Hanka" Grothendieck, came from a Protestant family in Hamburg and worked as a journalist. At the time of his birth, Grothendieck's mother was married to the journalist Johannes Raddatz, and the his parten's marriage en in 1929. W-II was a pretty hard time for Gronthendieck an his mother but also at the same was where that he apparently first became fascinated with mathematics.

The young Grothendieck'first mathetical studies where in France at University of Montpellier. In his thesis developed a measure equivalent to Lebesque's measure. After attendeding Henri Cartan's Seminar at École Normale Supérieure  he moved to the University of Nancy where he wrote his dissertation under Laurent Schwartz and Jean Dieudonné on functional analysis, from 1950 to 1953. but as early as 1957 dropped out functional analysis in order to work on  in algebraic geometry and homological algebra, where he made his greatest contribution to science.

In 1958 Grothendieck did start working at the Institut des hautes études scientifiques (IHÉS), created by himself and Jean Dieudonné. Grothendieck' work period at the IHÉS established several unifying themes in algebraic geometry, number theory, topology, category theory and complex analysis. At the moment his first discovery in algebraic geometry was the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem; in this context he also introduced K-theory. In his talk at the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians, he introduced the theory of schemes, developing it in detail in his Éléments de géométrie algébrique (EGA) wich was a change to algebraic geometry's foundations so important util our days. He went on to introduce the étale cohomology theory of schemes, as well the crystalline cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology. Also his work has had a great impact in ring theory through his students work. His mayor work is compiled at EGA and SGA notes nowadays there are some of them digitized, there are about 20000 pages of his work, so be patient and wait for them to be ready.

After his intense work at IHÉS he left it around the seventies after he learned that it was partly founded by military money. In 1991, Grothendieck moved to a new address which he did not provide to his previous contacts in the mathematical community, very few people knew it. In January 2010, Grothendieck wrote the letter "Déclaration d'intention de non-publication" to Luc Illusie, claiming that all materials published in his absence have been published without his permission. He asks that none of his work be reproduced in whole or in part and that copies of this work be removed from libraries. This order may have been reversed later in 2010..
On 13 November 2014, aged 86, Grothendieck died in the hospital of Saint-Girons, Ariège.
